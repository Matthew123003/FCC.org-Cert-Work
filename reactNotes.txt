To install React in a new or existing project, you can use a few
 different methods depending on your preferred setup. Here are the steps for
  the most common approaches:

### 1. Using Create React App
`Create React App` is an officially supported way to create single-page React 
applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.

#### Step-by-Step:

1. **Install Node.js**:
   Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Create React App**:
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```sh
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```
   This will create a new directory called `my-app` with a basic React setup.

3. **Navigate to Your App Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd my-app
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   This will start a development server and open your new React app in the browser.

### 2. Adding React to an Existing Project

If you have an existing project and you want to add React to it, follow these steps:

1. **Install React and React DOM**:
   ```sh
   npm install react react-dom
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Project Structure**:
   Create the following files if they don’t already exist:
   - `index.html`: The entry point for your application.
   - `index.js` (or `index.jsx`): The JavaScript file where you initialize React.

   Example `index.html`:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>My React App</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <div id="root"></div>
       <script src="index.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

   Example `index.js`:
   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

   function App() {
       return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
   }

   ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
   ```

3. **Set Up a Build Tool**:
   If you aren’t using a build tool like Webpack or Parcel, you should set one up.
    Here is a basic example using Webpack:

   - **Install Webpack and Babel**:
     ```sh
     npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react html-webpack-plugin
     ```

   - **Configure Webpack** (`webpack.config.js`):
     ```js
     const path = require('path');
     const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

     module.exports = {
         entry: './src/index.js',
         output: {
             path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
             filename: 'bundle.js',
         },
         module: {
             rules: [
                 {
                     test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
                     exclude: /node_modules/,
                     use: 'babel-loader',
                 },
             ],
         },
         resolve: {
             extensions: ['.js', '.jsx'],
         },
         plugins: [
             new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
                 template: './src/index.html',
             }),
         ],
         devServer: {
             contentBase: './dist',
         },
     };
     ```

   - **Configure Babel** (`.babelrc`):
     ```json
     {
         "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
     }
     ```

   - **Update Your Directory Structure**:
     Move your `index.html` and `index.js` into a `src` folder.

4. **Build and Start Your Project**:
   ```sh
   npx webpack serve
   ```
   This command will build your project and start a development server.

### 3. Using a CDN (For Prototyping)
If you’re just prototyping and don’t want to set up a build tool, you can use a CDN to include React in your project.

1. **Include React and ReactDOM via CDN**:
   Add the following script tags to your `index.html`:
   ```html
   <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js"></script>
   <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Create a Root Div and a Script to Render React**:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>My React App</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <div id="root"></div>
       <script>
           const e = React.createElement;

           function App() {
               return e('h1', null, 'Hello, React!');
           }

           ReactDOM.render(e(App), document.getElementById('root'));
       </script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

These are the most common ways to set up a React project. Choose the one that
 best suits your needs and preferences. If you're working on a larger or production
  project, using `Create React App` or setting up a custom build tool with Webpack
   and Babel is recommended for better development experience and flexibility.

   REACT NOTES BREAKDOWN AND BRIEF OVERVIEW OF HOW REACT WORKS

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly
 single-page applications where data changes over time. Developed and maintained by 
 Facebook, React allows developers to create large web applications that can update 
 and render efficiently in response to data changes. Here’s a detailed breakdown of React and how it works:

### Core Concepts of React

1. **Components**
2. **JSX**
3. **State and Props**
4. **Lifecycle Methods (Class Components) / Hooks (Functional Components)**
5. **Virtual DOM**
6. **One-Way Data Binding**

### 1. Components

React is component-based, meaning the UI is built using encapsulated components that
 manage their own state and logic. Components can be either class components or functional components.

#### Class Components

Class components are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`. They must include a 
`render` method that returns a React element.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello, {this.props.name}!</div>;
  }
}
```

#### Functional Components

Functional components are simpler and are typically used when you don't need to 
manage state. They are just JavaScript functions that return a React element.

```js
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div>Hello, {props.name}!</div>;
}
```

### 2. JSX

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript.
 React then transforms these JSX expressions into React elements. JSX makes it easier 
 to visualize the structure of the UI.

```js
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

### 3. State and Props

- **State**: State is a built-in React object used to contain data or information about
 the component. A component's state can change over time, and when it does, the component re-renders.

```js
class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  increment = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

- **Props**: Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes used to pass 
data from parent components to child components.

```js
function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function ParentComponent() {
  return <ChildComponent name="John" />;
}
```

### 4. Lifecycle Methods and Hooks

#### Lifecycle Methods (Class Components)

Lifecycle methods are special methods in class components that allow you to hook 
into specific moments in the component's life (e.g., when it mounts, updates, or unmounts).

- `componentDidMount`: Invoked immediately after a component is mounted.
- `componentDidUpdate`: Invoked immediately after updating occurs.
- `componentWillUnmount`: Invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed.

```js
class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Code to run after the component mounts
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    // Code to run after the component updates
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Code to run before the component unmounts
  }
}
```

#### Hooks (Functional Components)

Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional
 components. The most commonly used hooks are:

- `useState`: Allows you to add state to functional components.
- `useEffect`: Lets you perform side effects in functional components.

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Code to run after the component mounts or updates
    return () => {
      // Code to run before the component unmounts
    };
  }, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if count changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 5. Virtual DOM

The Virtual DOM is a concept where a virtual representation of the real DOM is kept
 in memory. When the state of an object changes, the virtual DOM is updated instead 
 of the real DOM. React then compares the virtual DOM with a snapshot of the real DOM
  taken before the update and updates the real DOM only where necessary. This process 
  is called "reconciliation" and it makes updates efficient.

### 6. One-Way Data Binding

React uses one-way data binding, meaning data flows in one direction from parent to 
child components. This makes it easier to understand how data changes affect the
 application and helps maintain the unidirectional data flow.

### Example of a React Application

Here’s a simple example of a React application that demonstrates these concepts:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### Summary

- **Components**: Building blocks of a React application.
- **JSX**: Syntax extension for JavaScript, allowing HTML-like code in JavaScript.
- **State**: Manages component-specific data.
- **Props**: Passes data from parent to child components.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: Hooks for class components to manage side effects and component states.
- **Hooks**: Functions like `useState` and `useEffect` that manage state and side effects in functional components.
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient way to update the real DOM by keeping a virtual representation in memory.
- **One-Way Data Binding**: Ensures a clear and predictable data flow.

React provides a powerful and flexible way to build interactive UIs, and its 
component-based architecture allows for the development of reusable and maintainable code.

Create a Simple JSX Element

React is an Open Source view library created and maintained by Facebook. It's a great tool
 to render the User Interface (UI) of modern web applications.

React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly
 within JavaScript. This has several benefits. It lets you use the full programmatic power of 
 JavaScript within HTML, and helps to keep your code readable. For the most part, JSX is similar
  to the HTML that you have already learned, however there are a few key differences that will be
   covered throughout these challenges.

For instance, because JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript, you can actually write JavaScript
 directly within JSX. To do this, you simply include the code you want to be treated as JavaScript
  within curly braces: { 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }. Keep this in mind, since it's used
   in several future challenges.

However, because JSX is not valid JavaScript, JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript. The transpiler
 Babel is a popular tool for this process. For your convenience, it's already added behind the scenes 
 for these challenges. If you happen to write syntactically invalid JSX, you will see the first test 
 in these challenges fail.

It's worth noting that under the hood the challenges are calling ReactDOM.render(JSX, 
document.getElementById('root')). This function call is what places your JSX into React's own lightweight
 representation of the DOM. React then uses snapshots of its own DOM to optimize updating only specific 
 parts of the actual DOM.

 One important thing to know about nested JSX is that it must return a single element.

This one parent element would wrap all of the other levels of nested elements.

For instance, several JSX elements written as siblings with no parent wrapper element will not transpile.

Here's an example:

Valid JSX:

<div>
  <p>Paragraph One</p>
  <p>Paragraph Two</p>
  <p>Paragraph Three</p>
</div>

Invalid JSX:

<p>Paragraph One</p>
<p>Paragraph Two</p>
<p>Paragraph Three</p>




JSX is a syntax that gets compiled into valid JavaScript. Sometimes, for readability, you 
might need to add comments to your code. Like most programming languages, JSX has its own way to do this.

To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax {/* */} to wrap around the comment text.




So far, you've learned that JSX is a convenient tool to write readable HTML within JavaScript.
 With React, we can render this JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React's rendering API known as ReactDOM.

ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this: 
ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode), where the first argument is the React element 
or component that you want to render, and the second argument is the DOM node that you want to
 render the component to.

As you would expect, ReactDOM.render() must be called after the JSX element declarations, just like
 how you must declare variables before using them.

 One key difference in JSX is that you can no longer use the word class to define HTML classes. 
 This is because class is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses className.

In fact, the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase.
 For example, a click event in JSX is onClick, instead of onclick. Likewise, onchange becomes onChange.
  While this is a subtle difference, it is an important one to keep in mind moving forward.




So far, you’ve seen how JSX differs from HTML in a key way with the use of className 
vs. class for defining HTML classes.

Another important way in which JSX differs from HTML is in the idea of the self-closing tag.

In HTML, almost all tags have both an opening and closing tag: <div></div>; the closing tag 
always has a forward slash before the tag name that you are closing. However, there are special 
instances in HTML called “self-closing tags”, or tags that don’t require both an opening and closing
 tag before another tag can start.

For example the line-break tag can be written as <br> or as <br />, but should never be written as 
<br></br>, since it doesn't contain any content.

In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, 
and every element must be closed. The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as <br /> 
in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled. A <div>, on the other hand, can be written as <div />
 or <div></div>. The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way to include anything
  in the <div />. You will see in later challenges that this syntax is useful when rendering React components.


There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. Defining 
a component in this way creates a stateless functional component. The concept of state in an application 
will be covered in later challenges. For now, think of a stateless component as one that can receive data
 and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data. (We'll cover the second way to create a
  React component in the next challenge.)

To create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or
 null. One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter.
  Here's an example of a stateless functional component that assigns an HTML class in JSX:

const DemoComponent = function() {
  return (
    <div className='customClass' />
  );
};

After being transpiled, the <div> will have a CSS class of customClass.

Because a JSX component represents HTML, you could put several components together to create a more complex
 HTML page. This is one of the key advantages of the component architecture React provides. It allows you to 
 compose your UI from many separate, isolated components. This makes it easier to build and maintain complex
  user interfaces.




The other way to define a React component is with the ES6 class syntax. In the 
following example, Kitten extends React.Component:

class Kitten extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}

This creates an ES6 class Kitten which extends the React.Component class. So 
the Kitten class now has access to many useful React features, such as local state
 and lifecycle hooks. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with these terms yet, they 
 will be covered in greater detail in later challenges. Also notice the Kitten class 
 has a constructor defined within it that calls super(). It uses super() to call the 
 constructor of the parent class, in this case React.Component. The constructor is a 
 special method used during the initialization of objects that are created with the class
  keyword. It is best practice to call a component's constructor with super, and pass props
   to both. This makes sure the component is initialized properly. For now, know that it is 
   standard for this code to be included. Soon you will see other uses for the constructor
    as well as props.


  

Now we will look at how we can compose multiple React components together. Imagine you
 are building an app and have created three components: a Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.

To compose these components together, you could create an App parent component which renders
 each of these three components as children. To render a component as a child in a React 
 component, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. For example,
  in the render method you could write:

return (
 <App>
  <Navbar />
  <Dashboard />
  <Footer />
 </App>
)

When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name 
wrapped in < /> like in this example), it renders the markup for that component in the location 
of the tag. This should illustrate the parent/child relationship between the App component and
 the Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.


*******************************************************************************************************************

You may remember using the ReactDOM API in an earlier challenge to render JSX elements to the
 DOM. The process for rendering React components will look very similar. The past few challenges
  focused on components and composition, so the rendering was done for you behind the scenes. However,
   none of the React code you write will render to the DOM without making a call to the ReactDOM API.

Here's a refresher on the syntax: ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode). The first argument
 is the React component that you want to render. The second argument is the DOM node that you want to
  render that component within.

React components are passed into ReactDOM.render() a little differently than JSX elements. For JSX 
elements, you pass in the name of the element that you want to render. However, for React components,
 you need to use the same syntax as if you were rendering a nested component, for example 
 ReactDOM.render(<ComponentToRender />, targetNode). You use this syntax for both ES6 class components 
 and functional components.

*******************************************************************************************************************




The previous challenges covered a lot about creating and composing JSX elements, 
functional components, and ES6 style class components in React. With this foundation, 
it's time to look at another feature very common in React: props. In React, you can pass
 props, or properties, to child components. Say you have an App component which renders
  a child component called Welcome which is a stateless functional component. You can pass 
  Welcome a user property by writing:

<App>
  <Welcome user='Mark' />
</App>

You use custom HTML attributes created by you and supported by React to be passed to the component.
 In this case, the created property user is passed to the component Welcome. Since Welcome is a
  stateless functional component, it has access to this value like so:

const Welcome = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.user}!</h1>

It is standard to call this value props and when dealing with stateless functional components,
 you basically consider it as an argument to a function which returns JSX. You can access the 
 value of the argument in the function body. With class components, you will see this is a little
  different.

**********************************************************************************************************************
React also has an option to set default props. You can assign default props to a component as a property on 
the component itself and React assigns the default prop if necessary. This allows you to specify what a prop
 value should be if no value is explicitly provided. For example, if you declare 
 MyComponent.defaultProps = { location: 'San Francisco' }, you have defined a location prop that's set to the 
 string San Francisco, unless you specify otherwise. React assigns default props if props are undefined, but if 
 you pass null as the value for a prop, it will remain null.

 Use PropTypes to Define the Props You Expect

React provides useful type-checking features to verify that components receive props of the 
correct type. For example, your application makes an API call to retrieve data that you expect 
to be in an array, which is then passed to a component as a prop. You can set propTypes on your
 component to require the data to be of type array. This will throw a useful warning when the
  data is of any other type.

It's considered a best practice to set propTypes when you know the type of a prop ahead of time.
 You can define a propTypes property for a component in the same way you defined defaultProps. 
 Doing this will check that props of a given key are present with a given type. Here's an example
  to require the type function for a prop called handleClick:

MyComponent.propTypes = { handleClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired }

In the example above, the PropTypes.func part checks that handleClick is a function. Adding 
isRequired tells React that handleClick is a required property for that component. You will 
see a warning if that prop isn't provided. Also notice that func represents function. Among 
the seven JavaScript primitive types, function and boolean (written as bool) are the only two
 that use unusual spelling. In addition to the primitive types, there are other types available.
  For example, you can check that a prop is a React element. Please refer to the documentation 
  for all of the options.

Note: As of React v15.5.0, PropTypes is imported independently from React,
 like this: import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

 *********************************************************************************************************************

 Review Using Props with Stateless Functional Components

Except for the last challenge, you've been passing props to stateless functional components. These components
 act like pure functions. They accept props as input and return the same view every time they are passed the 
 same props. You may be wondering what state is, and the next challenge will cover it in more detail. Before 
 that, here's a review of the terminology for components.

A stateless functional component is any function you write which accepts props and returns JSX. A stateless 
component, on the other hand, is a class that extends React.Component, but does not use internal state (covered
 in the next challenge). Finally, a stateful component is a class component that does maintain its own internal
  state. You may see stateful components referred to simply as components or React components.

A common pattern is to try to minimize statefulness and to create stateless functional components wherever possible.
 This helps contain your state management to a specific area of your application. In turn, this improves development
  and maintenance of your app by making it easier to follow how changes to state affect its behavior.
