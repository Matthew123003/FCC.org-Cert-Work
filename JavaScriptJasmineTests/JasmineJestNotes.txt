Both **Jasmine** and **Jest** are popular testing frameworks in the JavaScript ecosystem, but they cater to slightly different use cases and preferences. Here’s a comparison to help you understand their commonality and use cases:

### Jasmine
- **Originality**: Jasmine is one of the oldest testing frameworks for JavaScript and follows the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) approach. 
- **Focus**: It’s mainly focused on providing a syntax for writing tests, including spies and mocking.
- **Usage**: Often used in projects where minimal dependencies are desired. It’s the foundation for some other testing frameworks and libraries.
- **Setup**: Requires additional configuration for running tests in environments like Node.js or with libraries like Angular.
- **Learning Curve**: Generally easy to pick up, especially if you are following BDD practices.

### Jest
- **Popularity**: Jest has gained immense popularity in recent years, especially among React developers, and is often seen as the go-to testing framework for modern JavaScript applications.
- **All-in-One**: Jest comes with built-in test runners, assertion libraries, and mocking features, making it a comprehensive solution out of the box.
- **Ease of Use**: Jest is known for its zero-configuration setup, allowing for quick test creation and execution.
- **Snapshot Testing**: Provides features like snapshot testing for UI components, which is particularly useful in React applications.
- **Performance**: Jest runs tests in parallel, which can lead to faster execution times for larger test suites.

### Summary
- **Common Usage**: If you’re working with a React application or want an all-in-one solution, **Jest** is more commonly used and preferred due to its comprehensive features and ease of setup. 
- **Jasmine** is still relevant, especially in legacy projects or specific frameworks (like Angular), but it may require more manual setup and additional dependencies.

In modern JavaScript development, especially with the rise of frameworks like React and Vue, Jest tends to be the more common choice for new projects. However, if you have a specific project context or requirements, both frameworks can be suitable.
