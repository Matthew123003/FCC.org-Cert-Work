/*
Asynchronous and synchronous API calls each have their own advantages and disadvantages, and their use 
depends on the specific needs of your application. Let's explore both in detail.

### Synchronous API Calls

**Definition**: Synchronous API calls block the execution of code until the request is complete. The next
 line of code is executed only after the current operation finishes.

**Advantages**:
1. **Simplicity**: Easier to understand and implement since the code runs in a straightforward, sequential manner.
2. **Predictable Execution**: Since each operation waits for the previous one to complete, the order of
 execution is predictable, which can simplify debugging.

**Disadvantages**:
1. **Blocking Behavior**: If an API call takes a long time to complete, it blocks the entire thread,
 making the application unresponsive. This is particularly problematic in environments where responsiveness 
 is critical, like in UI applications.
2. **Scalability Issues**: In a server environment, synchronous operations can lead to poor performance and 
scalability issues since threads are blocked while waiting for responses.

**Example**:
*/
function makeSynchronousRequest(url) {
  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); // Creates a new XMLHttpRequest object for making HTTP requests
  xhr.open('GET', url, false); // Configures the request to use the GET method, specifies the URL, and sets the request to be synchronous ('false' makes it synchronous)
  xhr.send(); // Sends the request to the server
  if (xhr.status === 200) { // Checks if the HTTP status code is 200 (OK)
    console.log(xhr.responseText); // Logs the response text to the console if the request was successful
  }
}

makeSynchronousRequest('https://api.example.com/data'); // Executes the synchronous request with the provided URL

/*
### Asynchronous API Calls

**Definition**: Asynchronous API calls allow the execution of code to continue while waiting for the request to complete. The result of the API call is handled through callbacks, promises, or async/await.

**Advantages**:
1. **Non-Blocking**: The application remains responsive since it does not wait for the operation to complete before moving on to the next line of code.
2. **Improved Performance**: Especially in I/O-bound and high-latency operations, asynchronous calls can significantly improve the performance and scalability of an application.
3. **Concurrency**: Multiple operations can be executed concurrently, which is beneficial in handling multiple requests at the same time.

**Disadvantages**:
1. **Complexity**: Managing asynchronous code can be more complex, especially with nested callbacks (callback hell). However, this can be mitigated using promises and async/await.
2. **Error Handling**: Handling errors in asynchronous code can be more challenging and requires careful design to ensure that all potential issues are caught and handled properly.

**Example Using Promises**:
*/
function makeAsynchronousRequest(url) {
  fetch(url) // Initiates a fetch request to the provided URL
    .then(response => { // Handles the response when it is received
      if (!response.ok) { // Checks if the response status is not OK
        throw new Error('Network response was not ok'); // Throws an error if the response was not OK
      }
      return response.json(); // Parses the response body as JSON
    })
    .then(data => { // Handles the parsed JSON data
      console.log(data); // Logs the data to the console
    })
    .catch(error => { // Catches and handles any errors that occurred during the fetch operation
      console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error); // Logs an error message if there was a problem with the fetch
    });
}

makeAsynchronousRequest('https://api.example.com/data'); // Executes the asynchronous request with the provided URL

/*
**Example Using async/await**:
*/
async function makeAsynchronousRequest(url) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url); // Waits for the fetch request to complete and retrieves the response
    if (!response.ok) { // Checks if the response status is not OK
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok'); // Throws an error if the response was not OK
    }
    const data = await response.json(); // Waits for the response body to be parsed as JSON
    console.log(data); // Logs the data to the console
  } catch (error) { // Catches and handles any errors that occurred during the fetch operation
    console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error); // Logs an error message if there was a problem with the fetch
  }
}

makeAsynchronousRequest('https://api.example.com/data'); // Executes the asynchronous request with the provided URL

/*
### Summary

- **Synchronous API Calls**:
  - **Pros**: Simpler to write and understand; predictable execution.
  - **Cons**: Blocks the execution thread, leading to unresponsiveness and scalability issues.

- **Asynchronous API Calls**:
  - **Pros**: Non-blocking, leading to better responsiveness and scalability; allows concurrent operations.
  - **Cons**: More complex to manage, especially in error handling and when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations.

Choosing between synchronous and asynchronous API calls depends on the specific requirements of your application.
 Asynchronous calls are generally preferred in modern web development due to their non-blocking nature, which enhances
  performance and user experience.
